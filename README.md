I build this project while working on lesson one of the [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/) course called 'Asynchronous JavaScript Requests'.
Clink [here](https://eu.udacity.com/course/asynchronous-javascript-requests--ud109) to see the course.

In this project, I used an AJAX request with an XHR object to fetch data from unsplash and New York Times api.
